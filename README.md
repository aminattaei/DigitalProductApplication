# üõí Electro - Online Digital Store

Electro is a modern web application designed for selling digital products such as laptops, smartphones, and other electronic devices.  
It has been built with **Django**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Django REST Framework (DRF)** to ensure scalability, reliability, and flexibility.  

The project demonstrates a clean architecture where the backend handles all business logic and database operations, while the frontend is based on Django templates and can be easily replaced with React, Vue, or any mobile app that consumes the RESTful API.  

Electro allows administrators to manage products, categories, and digital files with ease, while users can browse items, view product details, and interact with the system. The database is powered by PostgreSQL, which provides robust support for relational data and performance optimization.  

Security and extensibility are core priorities of this project. Authentication and authorization are managed using Django‚Äôs built-in system, and the API endpoints are secured for future use with JWT or token-based authentication. The REST API makes it possible to integrate Electro with external systems, mobile applications, or modern single-page applications.  

Future development will include advanced features such as a shopping cart, order history, payment integration, and a wishlist system. This project can serve as a learning resource for developers who want to explore Django with DRF and PostgreSQL, or as a starting point for building a production-ready e-commerce platform.
